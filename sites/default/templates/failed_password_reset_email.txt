Hello.

You are receiving this notification because you (or someone pretending
to be you) requested that the password for a NextThought account
be reset.

Unfortunately, we do not have a registration for that account and this
email address, and so the reset failed.

If you were expecting this email, please try again with the username
and email address of your registered account.

If you did not make this request, you can safely disregard this email.

For help, you can email us at ${support_email}.
